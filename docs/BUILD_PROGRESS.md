# Build progress log (durable — survives context loss)

Running log of the UI build (docs/UI_ROADMAP.md). Updated after each step so work
can resume cold. Newest phase on top.

## U1 — display bring-up (ILI9341/ST7789)   [DONE ✓]

**RESULT:** ILI9341 works in **portrait 240×320** on SPI3 @ 20 MHz (pins SCLK14
MOSI13 DC2 CS15 BL21), MADCTL 0x48, no inversion. User confirmed colors +
orientation correct. Layout zones defined: PDA area 240×208 on top, Graffiti
input strip 240×112 on the bottom (with letters|numbers split). display.[ch]
in firmware/main. Next: U2 touch (XPT2046).


**Goal:** get pixels on the 2.8" 320×240 panel via a dependency-free SPI driver
(no managed components), draw a diagnostic test pattern, confirm panel type +
color order + orientation. Verification needs the USER's eyes (no camera here).

Plan/pins: TFT on **SPI3** (SD is on SPI2 — no bus conflict). Pins SCLK14 MOSI13
DC2 CS15 RST-1(software reset) BL21. Driver in firmware/main/display.[ch]:
init + fill_rect via a one-row buffer (RGB565). Test pattern = 4 colored
quadrants (TL red / TR green / BL blue / BR white) + yellow border, so the user
report disambiguates: color order (RGB vs BGR = red/blue swap), inversion
(negative colors), orientation (which quadrant is where), and addressing
offset (border complete?).

### Step log
- U1.1: wrote display.[ch] (ILI9341, SPI3, pins 14/13/2/15/BL21), test pattern.
- U1.2: FIX crash — 40MHz rejected (TFT pins route via GPIO matrix on SPI3, cap
  ~26.7MHz). Dropped to 20MHz. Panel init + test pattern now run clean (serial
  confirms). AWAITING user's on-screen report (colors/orientation/border).
  Tweakables in display.c if wrong: MADCTL_VAL, INVERT, PANEL_ST7789.
- U1.3: user requires PORTRAIT (Palm PDA on top, Graffiti strip bottom). Switched
  to 240x320 (LCD_W/H), MADCTL 0x48, GRAFFITI_H=64/PDA_H in display.h. New test
  pattern previews the layout: blue title bar + gray PDA body (top), gray Graffiti
  strip (bottom), RED dot TL / GREEN dot TR for orientation, yellow border.
  Flashed clean. Panel confirmed working in portrait (user could identify regions).
- U1.4: user feedback "graffiti area too small". Bumped GRAFFITI_H 64→112 (~35%,
  PDA_H=208), added Palm-style letters|numbers vertical divider in the strip.
  Re-flashed. AWAITING confirm on size + colors/orientation to close U1.

## U0 — sync working set: static BSS → heap   [DONE ✓ d7031ed]

**RESULT (measured on hardware):** static DRAM 174 KB→47 KB (−127 KB); boot free
heap **129 KB → 256 KB** (+127 KB), largest block 110→127 KB. All 5 host gates
green. This is the UI budget unlocked — ~256 KB free in UI mode; sync buffers are
malloc'd during a sync and freed after, so they don't tax interactive mode.


**Goal:** the big sync buffers are `static` (permanently resident in BSS). With
`--gc-sections`, the resident ones today are `sync_collection`'s `S`+`Out` and
`sync_one`'s `nodes[]`+`Sink` (~123 KB). Making them heap (malloc-on-sync /
free-after) hands that ~123 KB back to UI mode; peak-during-sync is unchanged
(they're needed then). Both host and device convert to heap (identical behavior;
gates prove it). Verify: all 5 host gates green + firmware BSS drops + boot heap
rises.

Targets in `bridge/sync.c`:
- [x] `sync_one`: `static Node nodes[MAXR*2]` + `static Sink kbuf` → heap (+free)
- [x] `sync_collection`: `static S s` + `static Out o` → heap (+free)
- [x] `sync_categorized`: `static S all` + `static Out o` + `static S sub` → heap
- [x] `sync_pull`: `static uint8_t arena[ARENA_CAP]` + `static PdbRec recs[MAXR]`
      → heap (and fix `sizeof arena` → `ARENA_CAP`); also NameList → heap
- [x] add alloc-failure handling (log + graceful return)
- [x] host: `make test itest stest ctest` + `dav_roundtrip.sh` all green
- [x] device: `idf.py size` BSS delta + flash + boot free-heap delta
- [x] commit + push

### Step log
- U0.1 DONE: sync_one nodes[]+Sink → calloc/free, alloc-fail guard. `make itest` green.
- U0.2 DONE: sync_collection S+Out → calloc/free (returns -1 on OOM). itest+stest green.
- U0.3 DONE: sync_categorized all+o+sub → calloc/free (sub reused via memset in loop). ctest green.
- U0.4 DONE: sync_pull arena+recs+NameList → heap, sizeof→ARENA_CAP. dav_roundtrip green.
- U0.5 DONE: full host sweep green (test 285/0, itest, stest, ctest, dav_roundtrip).
- U0.6 DONE: firmware static DRAM 174K→47K; boot heap 129K→256K on hardware.

## Status of everything else (as of U0 start)
- Phase A (contacts) + Phase B (ESP32 port) DONE, on hardware; discovery smoke
  test proven vs live iCloud (commits through f7bac41).
- UI decision: LVGL skinned with real Palm assets + PumpkinOS layouts; firmware
  GPLv3 (357f044). Roadmap: docs/UI_ROADMAP.md.
- Next after U0: U1 display bring-up (ILI9341/ST7789), then U2 touch.
